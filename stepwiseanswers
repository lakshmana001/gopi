1. Write the unit test cases using Pytest testing framework in the following path '~/Desktop/Project/wingst5-may2023-s1h1/test.py'

Sol : 
Certainly! Here's an example of how you can write unit test cases using Pytest for the Kanban board Flask application. Please note that this is just an example, and you may need to adapt it to match your specific application.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `~/Desktop/Project/wingst5-may2023-s1h1` directory.
2. Create a new file named `test.py` in this directory.
3. Open the `test.py` file and import the necessary libraries for testing:

```python
import pytest
import requests
```

4. Write test cases to cover different aspects of the Kanban board Flask application. Here's an example of a test function for creating a task:

```python
def test_create_task():
    # Make a POST request to the create task endpoint
    response = requests.post('http://localhost:5005/tasks', json={'title': 'Test Task'})

    # Assert that the response status code is 201 (Created)
    assert response.status_code == 201

    # Assert that the response JSON contains the created task
    assert 'Test Task' in response.json()['title']
```

5. Add more test functions to cover other endpoints and scenarios as needed. For example:

```python
def test_get_task():
    # Make a GET request to retrieve a task
    response = requests.get('http://localhost:5005/tasks/1')

    # Assert that the response status code is 200 (OK)
    assert response.status_code == 200

    # Assert that the response JSON contains the expected task ID
    assert response.json()['id'] == 1

def test_update_task():
    # Make a PUT request to update a task
    response = requests.put('http://localhost:5005/tasks/1', json={'title': 'Updated Task'})

    # Assert that the response status code is 200 (OK)
    assert response.status_code == 200

    # Assert that the task has been updated
    assert response.json()['title'] == 'Updated Task'

def test_delete_task():
    # Make a DELETE request to delete a task
    response = requests.delete('http://localhost:5005/tasks/1')

    # Assert that the response status code is 204 (No Content)
    assert response.status_code == 204

    # Assert that the task has been deleted
    assert response.text == ''
```

6. Save and close the `test.py` file.

Now, you can run the test cases using the following command:

```bash
python3 -m pytest test.py
```

Make sure to have the Flask application running in another terminal window while running the tests. The test results will be displayed in the terminal, indicating whether the tests passed or failed. You can refine and update the test cases as needed to achieve appropriate test coverage.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Refer 'test.py' file for further instructions.

Sol:
I apologize for the confusion. Unfortunately, I don't have access to external files such as `test.py` or any specific instructions mentioned in it. However, I can help you with general guidelines and examples for writing unit tests using Pytest.

To proceed with writing unit test cases using Pytest, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `~/Desktop/Project/wingst5-may2023-s1h1` directory.
2. Create a new file named `test.py` in this directory.
3. Open the `test.py` file in a text editor.

Inside the `test.py` file, you can start writing your unit test cases using the Pytest framework. Pytest provides a clean and simple syntax for writing test functions and assertions.

Here's an example structure for the `test.py` file:

```python
import pytest
import requests

# Import necessary modules and functions from your application if required

# Define your test functions using the `test_` prefix

def test_example():
    # Write your test case here
    # Use assertions to validate the expected behavior of your application
    assert 1 + 1 == 2

def test_another_example():
    # Write another test case here
    # Use assertions to validate the expected behavior of your application
    assert [1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3]

# Add more test functions as needed

# Optionally, you can define fixtures to set up test data or perform setup/teardown operations

# Run the test cases using the pytest framework

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pytest.main()
```

In this example, you can add your test functions using the `test_` prefix. Inside each test function, use assertions to validate the expected behavior of your application. You can make use of the necessary modules and functions from your application, if required, to perform the tests.

After adding your test functions, you can run the test cases by executing the `test.py` file using the Python interpreter. In the terminal, navigate to the `~/Desktop/Project/wingst5-may2023-s1h1` directory and run the command:

```bash
python3 test.py
```

Pytest will discover and execute the test functions defined in the file. The test results will be displayed in the terminal, indicating whether the tests passed or failed.

Please note that the above example is a basic structure, and you need to tailor it according to your specific application and test requirements.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Commands to Execute:
    - 'export FLASK_APP=app.py' to set an environment variable.
    - 'python3 -m flask run' to run the Flask application.
    - 'python3 -m pytest test.py' to run the test cases.
    
Sol:
Sure! Here are the commands you can execute to set the environment variable, run the Flask application, and run the test cases using Pytest:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `~/Desktop/Project/wingst5-may2023-s1h1` directory.
2. Execute the following command to set the environment variable:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
```

This command sets the `FLASK_APP` environment variable to `app.py`, which is the name of your Flask application file.

3. Run the Flask application using the following command:

```bash
python3 -m flask run
```

This command starts the Flask development server and runs your application.

4. Open another terminal window and navigate to the same directory (`~/Desktop/Project/wingst5-may2023-s1h1`).
5. Execute the following command to run the test cases using Pytest:

```bash
python3 -m pytest test.py
```

This command runs the test cases defined in the `test.py` file using the Pytest framework. Pytest will discover and execute the test functions defined in the file, and the test results will be displayed in the terminal.

Please note that you need to have the Flask application running in one terminal window while running the test cases in another terminal window.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Once you done with test cases. Deploy the Kanbanboard Flask application in Docker using Docker Compose.
Sol:
To deploy the Kanban board Flask application in Docker using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `Dockerfile` in the `~/Desktop/Project/wingst5-may2023-s1h1` directory.
2. Open the `Dockerfile` file in a text editor.

Inside the `Dockerfile`, you will define the Docker image for your Flask application. Here's an example of a basic `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

ENV FLASK_APP=app.py

EXPOSE 5005

CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
```

In this example, the Docker image is based on the `python:3.7-alpine` image, sets the working directory to `/app`, copies the `requirements.txt` file, installs the dependencies, copies the entire project directory, sets the `FLASK_APP` environment variable to `app.py`, exposes port `5005`, and runs the Flask application using the `flask run` command.

3. Save and close the `Dockerfile`.

4. Create a new file named `docker-compose.yml` in the `~/Desktop/Project/wingst5-may2023-s1h1` directory.
5. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file in a text editor.

Inside the `docker-compose.yml`, you will define the Docker Compose configuration for your application. Here's an example of a basic `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: kanbanboard_app_container
    networks:
      - app_network
    ports:
      - '5005:5005'
    volumes:
      - app_volume:/app

networks:
  app_network:

volumes:
  app_volume:
```

In this example, a service named `app` is defined. It builds the Docker image using the `Dockerfile` in the current directory, sets the container name to `kanbanboard_app_container`, connects to a network named `app_network`, maps port `5005` on the host to port `5005` in the container, and mounts a volume named `app_volume` to persist the application data.

6. Save and close the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Now, you can deploy the Kanban board Flask application using Docker Compose. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `~/Desktop/Project/wingst5-may2023-s1h1` directory.
2. Run the following command to build and deploy the application using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command builds the Docker image and starts the container with the Kanban board application. The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode.

3. Once the container is up and running, you can visit `http://localhost:5005/` in your browser to ensure that the application is running successfully.

That's it! You have now successfully deployed the Kanban board Flask application in Docker using Docker Compose.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Create a 'Dockerfile' to dockerize the Kanbanboard Flask application with 'python alpine3.7' as its base image named 'kanbanboard_app_image'.

Sol:
Certainly! Here's an example of a `Dockerfile` that dockerizes the Kanban board Flask application using the `python:3.7-alpine` base image and names the Docker image as `kanbanboard_app_image`:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

ENV FLASK_APP=app.py

EXPOSE 5005

CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
```

In this `Dockerfile`, the base image is set to `python:3.7-alpine`, which provides a lightweight Alpine Linux-based environment with Python 3.7 installed. It sets the working directory to `/app`, copies the `requirements.txt` file, installs the dependencies using `pip`, copies the entire project directory, sets the `FLASK_APP` environment variable to `app.py`, exposes port `5005`, and runs the Flask application using the `flask run` command.

To create the `kanbanboard_app_image` Docker image using this `Dockerfile`, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your `Dockerfile` is located (`~/Desktop/Project/wingst5-may2023-s1h1`).
2. Execute the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t kanbanboard_app_image .
```

This command builds the Docker image using the `Dockerfile` in the current directory (`.`). The `-t` flag tags the image with the name `kanbanboard_app_image`.

3. Wait for the build process to complete. It may take a few moments to download the necessary dependencies and build the image.

Once the build process is complete, you will have a Docker image named `kanbanboard_app_image` that contains your Kanban board Flask application.

You can use this image to run containers and deploy your application using Docker or Docker Compose.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Create 'docker-compose.yml' file to create a service named 'app' with the docker image (kanbanboard_app_image), container named 'kanbanboard_app_container', connect a bridge network named 'app_network', attach a volume named 'app_volume' and deploy the application in 5005 port.

SOl:
Certainly! Here's an example of a `docker-compose.yml` file that creates a service named 'app' using the `kanbanboard_app_image` Docker image. It also names the container as 'kanbanboard_app_container', connects to a bridge network named 'app_network', attaches a volume named 'app_volume', and deploys the application on port 5005:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    image: kanbanboard_app_image
    container_name: kanbanboard_app_container
    networks:
      - app_network
    ports:
      - '5005:5005'
    volumes:
      - app_volume:/app

networks:
  app_network:

volumes:
  app_volume:
```

In this `docker-compose.yml` file:

- The `image` field specifies the Docker image to use, which is `kanbanboard_app_image`.
- The `container_name` field sets the name of the container to 'kanbanboard_app_container'.
- The `networks` section defines a bridge network named 'app_network' that the container will be connected to.
- The `ports` section maps port 5005 on the host to port 5005 in the container.
- The `volumes` section attaches a volume named 'app_volume' to persist the application data.

To deploy the application using this `docker-compose.yml` file, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located (`~/Desktop/Project/wingst5-may2023-s1h1`).
2. Execute the following command to start the application using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command reads the `docker-compose.yml` file and starts the containers defined in it. The `-d` flag runs the containers in detached mode.

3. Wait for the containers to start. You can check the status of the containers using the `docker ps` command.

Once the containers are up and running, your Kanban board Flask application will be deployed and accessible at `http://localhost:5005/`.

Note: Make sure you have previously built the `kanbanboard_app_image` Docker image using the `Dockerfile` before running `docker-compose up -d`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Visit "http://localhost:5005/" URL in the browser and ensure that the application is running successful.
Sol:
As an AI language model, I don't have a web browser to access URLs. However, you can follow these steps to visit `http://localhost:5005/` in your browser and ensure that the Kanban board Flask application is running successfully:

1. Make sure you have successfully deployed the application using Docker Compose by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Open your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

3. In the address bar of the web browser, enter the following URL and press Enter:

```
http://localhost:5005/
```

4. The browser will send a request to the Flask application running on port 5005 in your local machine.

5. If the application is running successfully, you should see the Kanban board application's user interface or any other content that is being served by the Flask application.

If you encounter any issues or errors, please ensure that the Docker containers are running and the application has started correctly. You can also check the logs of the container using the `docker logs kanbanboard_app_container` command to see if there are any error messages that might help diagnose the issue.

============================================================================================
The End.
