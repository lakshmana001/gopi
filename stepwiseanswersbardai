1. Write the unit test cases using Pytest testing framework in the following path '~/Desktop/Project/wingst5-may2023-s1h1/test.py'

Sol: 
Sure, here is the unit test cases using Pytest testing framework in the following path '~/Desktop/Project/wingst5-may2023-s1h1/test.py':

Python
import pytest

from wingst5_may2023_s1h1 import add, subtract, multiply, divide


def test_add():
    assert add(1, 2) == 3
    assert add(3, 4) == 7


def test_subtract():
    assert subtract(5, 2) == 3
    assert subtract(8, 4) == 4


def test_multiply():
    assert multiply(2, 3) == 6
    assert multiply(4, 5) == 20


def test_divide():
    assert divide(12, 3) == 4
    assert divide(20, 5) == 4


if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main()
Use code with caution. Learn more
This code will test the four functions in the wingst5_may2023_s1h1 module. The add() function will be tested with two different inputs, and the expected output will be compared to the actual output. The subtract(), multiply(), and divide() functions will be tested with the same methodology.

The pytest testing framework will run the tests and report any failures. If all of the tests pass, then the code is considered to be working correctly.

==============================================================================================================================================================
