Write the unit test cases.
Open the test.py file and add the following unit test cases:

Code snippet
import pytest

from app import app


@pytest.fixture
def client():
    app.testing = True
    client = app.test_client()
    yield client


def test_index(client):
    response = client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.content == b"Hello, World!"


def test_create_task(client):
    data = {"title": "New Task"}
    response = client.post("/tasks", data=data)
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.content == b"Task created successfully!"

Create the docker-compose.yml file.
Open the docker-compose.yml file and add the following contents:

Code snippet
version: "3.8"

services:
  app:
    image: kanbanboard_app_image
    container_name: kanbanboard_app_container
    networks:
      - app_network
    volumes:
      - app_volume:/app

networks:
  app_network:
